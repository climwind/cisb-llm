/**
 * @name CISB: Switch Fall-Through with Unprotected Address Calculation
 * @description Detects switch statements with missing case terminators that allow implicit fall-through. 
 *              Combined with unprotected address calculations and memory accesses, aggressive compiler 
 *              optimizations may duplicate or reorder these calculations across fall-through paths, 
 *              leading to mismatched memory access sizes and potential information disclosure.
 * @kind problem
 * @problem.severity warning
 * @precision medium
 * @id cpp/cisb-switch-fallthrough
